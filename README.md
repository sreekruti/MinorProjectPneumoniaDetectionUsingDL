# MinorProjectPneumoniaDetectionUsingDL
This is my college minor project in final year on Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning Techniques
In particular, the research aimed to:
1. Examine how well deep learning algorithms—such as VGG19, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, 
MobileNet, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—identify pneumonia from chest 
X-ray pictures.
2. Examine MobileNet's potential as an exceptional performer compared to the other 
algorithms that were considered for the diagnosis of pneumonia.
3. Examine MobileNet's scalability and flexibility for uses in medical imaging that go beyond 
the detection of pneumonia.

4. Emphasize how AI-driven solutions may revolutionize healthcare accessibility, 
particularly in environments with limited resources.
5. Determine the directions for future study, including large-scale implementation, transfer 
learning, multimodal imaging, real-time diagnosis, continuous learning, and environment 
adaption with limited resources.
